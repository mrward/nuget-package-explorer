# NuGet Package Explorer for Android and iOS

Inspired by the original [NuGet Package Explorer](https://npe.codeplex.com/) which was created by [Luan Nguyen](https://twitter.com/dotnetjunky) and runs on Windows.

This version of the NuGet Package Explorer uses [Xamarin.Forms](http://xamarin.com/forms) and runs on Android and iOS.
